Repo for a SVM Image Classifier
## About the Project
Scraped Dataset containing 10 images each for Banana and oranges from https://unsplash.com/ using BeautifulSoup.

Cleaned the images by scaling them to standard dimensions and flattened the data.

Created a SVM model to classify the images followed by testing them over random images from the Web.
